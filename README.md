# Frontend Mentor - Challenge Solutions
This repository is a collection of my completed Frontend Mentor challenges. Each subdirectory within this repository contains an individual project. Projects that require their own repository will be still be included and linked in the table below, but not exist within this repository itself. 

## Purpose
This is a showcase of the projects I have completed with Frontend Mentor. I hope to gain knowledge and improve my coding ability through building realistic projects. Each subdocument/project contains its own README.md that provides details explaining what I learnt, the process I took when building the project and some screenshots and links.
